This is assignment 1 for the course.

In this assignment we simulate a 1D walker. 

For part-1, we plot the positions of the particle vs the number of steps taken by the observer, we do this for n = 10,100,1000 steps and we simulate 1000 such walsk for all values of n.

for part-2, we look at the distribution of final positions and observe that it resembles a normal distribution, which verifies for us the central limit theorem.
